  # Recipe Cleanup Query with Cascading Deletes
  
  This query safely removes a recipe and all related records:
  - user_recipes (user-recipe relationships)
  - recipe_allergens (recipe-allergen relationships) 
  - recipe_dietary_prefs (recipe-dietary preference relationships)
  - recipe_cooking_methods (recipe-cooking method relationships)
  - The recipe itself from recipes table
  
  The CASCADE constraints should handle most relationships automatically,
  but we'll be explicit for safety.
