  # Delete User Data Script
  
  This script safely removes a user and all related records:
  - user_recipes (user-recipe relationships)
  - user_allergens (user allergen preferences)
  - user_dietary_prefs (user dietary preferences)
  - user_profiles (user profile information)
  - auth.users (the user account itself - optional)
  
  Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE' with the actual user ID you want to delete.
